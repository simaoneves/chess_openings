Chess Openings
==========================
Future Ruby gem to calculate Chess Openings from a PGN file (and others)

## TODOS:
- ~~Get dictionary of all openings~~ and ~~Transform dictionary in to JSON~~
- ~~Divide files~~
- ~~Use Tests~~
- Write documentation
- Wrap everything up in a Ruby gem
- ~~Get opening from PGN file~~
- ~~Get opening from PGN string~~
- ~~Get opening from array with moves~~
- Get opening from FEN (maybe?)
- ~~Search opening by name~~
- ~~Get all openings~~
- ~~Get all openings that start with some determined moves~~
- ~~Get PGN string from an opening~~
- Raise error if no opening found (search all with moves)
- "Get all openings that start with some determined moves" is returning more openings that is suposed to, i think it ignores the last move

## Features:
- Get opening from PGN file
- Get opening from PGN string
- Get opening from array with moves
- Get opening from FEN (maybe?)
- Search opening by name
- Get all openings
- Get all openings that start with some determined moves
